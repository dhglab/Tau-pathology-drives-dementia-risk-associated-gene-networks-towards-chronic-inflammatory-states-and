This code is companion to (Rexach et al, 2020) "Tau pathology drives dementia risk-associated gene networks towards chronic inflammatory states and immunosuppression"

The code provided is for the consensus WGCNA network analysis that combines Tg4510 Tau mouse purified microglia (cortex; data source Wang et al.2018; PMID 30558641) and TPR50 Tau mouse brain dataset (cortex; 6 months old; data source Swarup et al 2019; PMID 30510257) 

The repository has 4 folders - code, data_provided, data_generated and figures. The R code to replicate the analyses are in the code folder. The input data in the form of RData files can be found under data_provided.
