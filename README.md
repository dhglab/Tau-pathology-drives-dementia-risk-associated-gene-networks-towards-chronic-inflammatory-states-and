This code is companion to (Rexach et al, 2020) "Tau pathology drives dementia risk-associated gene networks towards chronic inflammatory states and immunosuppression"

The code file provides code in R for 1. a consensus WGCNA network analysis (Rexach et al, 2020) that combines Tg4510 Tau mouse purified microglia (cortex; data source Wang et al.2018; PMID 30558641) and TPR50 Tau mouse brain dataset (cortex; 6 months old; data source Swarup et al 2019; PMID 30510257) and 2. a secondary clustering analysis of selected modules to explore for additional biological associations  (Rexach et al, 2020).

The repository has one code file () and all necesseary formatted input data files required to run the code in the form of .RData and .csv files.
