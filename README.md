This code is companion to (Rexach et al, 2020) "Tau pathology drives dementia risk-associated gene networks towards chronic inflammatory states and immunosuppression"

The code provided is for 1. the consensus WGCNA network analysis that combines Tg4510 Tau mouse purified microglia (cortex; data source Wang et al.2018; PMID 30558641) and TPR50 Tau mouse brain dataset (cortex; 6 months old; data source Swarup et al 2019; PMID 30510257) and 2. secondary clustering of selected modules to test for additional biological associations.

The repository has 2 folders - code and data_provided. The R code to replicate the analyses are in the code folder. The processed input data formatted and ready for both analysis can be found under data_provided folder in the form of RData and .csv files.
